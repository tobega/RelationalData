# RelationalData
Relational algebra and database language based on [The Third Manifesto](http://thethirdmanifesto.com/)

This is a proof-of-concept and the algebra is not complete

Development is currently paused as I'm not sure where I want to go with this. It could be a nice way to
do complex operations with a more powerful datatype than a Dict or it could be a nice/sane way to interact with
a database by transforming relational operations into SQL. Or maybe even both.
